The Senate Address Geo-coding Engine (SAGE) is a web application used to provide
geo-mapping information to users. It includes address verification/correction,
geo-coding of addresses, and district assignment using either Board of Election
street files or TIGER/Line shapefiles. Most of SAGE's functionality is handled
by third-party libraries and services, such as the USPS Address Information
System, as well as geocoders from NYS Geo and Google.

SAGE is developed primarily by the Application Development unit at the
New York State Senate.
